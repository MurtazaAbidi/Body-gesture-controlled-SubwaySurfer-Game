# Body-gesture-controlled-SubwaySurfer-Game
This project uses body gesture detection to play a subway surfer game (or one similar to it) by controlling the movement of the man running on the screen. It has been developed in Python using the Pyautogui module and OpenCV. Although this demo focuses on playing the Subway Surfer game, it may be used to run any application or play any game using simply body motions.
